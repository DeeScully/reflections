When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to be able to access the file wherever you're able to get an internet connection.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The file might be very large and take a lot of time/resources to pull.  Manual pulls allows the user to determine when is the best time to utilize the time/resources.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork = clone that exists on github. Used to copy a repo so that github auto informs orig repo that it's been copied and by whom.  Also allows copier to suggest changes to the owner of orig repo.
    Clone = copy of a remote repo onto your local machine.
    Branch = separate leg of a main line of changes. Used so that test/experimental changes can be made without disrupting orig code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I'd be able to compare changes I've made locally to the last known remote file while offline.
