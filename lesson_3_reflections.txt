When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to be able to access the file wherever you're able to get an internet connection.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The file might be very large and take a lot of time/resources to pull.  Manual pulls allows the user to determine when is the best time to utilize the time/resources.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork = clone that exists on github. Used to copy a repo so that github auto informs orig repo that it's been copied and by whom.  Also allows copier to suggest changes to the owner of orig repo.
    Clone = copy of a remote repo onto your local machine.
    Branch = separate leg of a main line of changes. Used so that test/experimental changes can be made without disrupting orig code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I'd be able to compare changes I've made locally to the last known remote file while offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    There would be a lot of texting communique back and forth. Noticing errors would be easier because there would be multiple sets of eyes reviewing the edits.  It would be harder to keep track of multiple changes, since we'd have to review past text messages instead of having them nicely presented in the app.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Master is only for files with stable data.  I'd want to establish a branch to experiment/test, that way if I introduce errors, it will not interfere with my stable master branch.
